## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first self project I built using Flexbox. I'm working on my front-end skills and felt that this one would be a good one to try something new that I have learned. I felt it was a good challenge.

### Continued development

I am going to be working rebuilding my portfolio this summer. I would like to build a blog post site. I will be working on all front-end skills and mainly using React as a front-end framework.
